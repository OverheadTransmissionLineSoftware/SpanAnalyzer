## SpanAnalyzer
This repository contains a desktop application that models the sag-tension
response of transmisison cables.

## Platforms
This application is built using the wxWidgets framework, and is supported on the
following platforms:
* Linux (Ubuntu)
* Windows 10

## Branches
The master branch contains stable code most of the time, but it's best to use
specific [releases](https://github.com/OverheadTransmissionLineSoftware/SpanAnalyzer/releases)
 of the master branch whenever possible.

## Get Involved!
This is an open source effort to create transmission line design software. This
software is released in the public domain (see
[UNLICENSE](https://github.com/OverheadTransmissionLineSoftware/SpanAnalyzer/blob/master/UNLICENSE)
 file), so we can contribute to this collectively without worrying about
intellectual property.
