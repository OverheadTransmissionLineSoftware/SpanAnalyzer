This file is intended for linux Code::Blocks builds ONLY.

Build Models Libraries
======================
  - Build using the Code::Blocks file in the following build/codeblocks
    subdirectory in the Models repo.

Build wxWidgets Libraries
=========================
  - Follow the wx documentation for platform-specific instructions
  - After generating the configuration file (before building the libraries),
    the following declaration must set:
      #define wxUSE_STD_IOSTREAM 0

    This is required by the SpanAnalyzerDocument to capture document open/save
    streams. See include/span_analyzer_doc.h for more details.

Setup the Code::Blocks File
===========================
The Models library build parameters are already setup in the Code::Blocks file.

The wxWidgets build library parameters have to be manually set in the
Code::Blocks file because the wxWidgets libraries can be configured/built so
many different ways. Using wx-config is super handy for providing all the
necessary compiler/linker flags. If you can point to wx-config from Code::Blocks
on your system - do it! If you can't, run wx-config and put in flags that it
spits out.

  - Define build directory variables
      MODELS (optional - already points to subdirectory)
      WXWIDGETS (optional - already points to subdirectory)
      WXWIDGETS_CONFIG (required when not using wx-config, for both debug AND
                        release)

  - Add compilation flags and directories. Either point Code::Blocks to the
    following command surrounded by backticks (` `), or run the command and
    input the flags:
      wx-config --cxxflags

  - Add linker flags and directories. Either point Code::Blocks to the
    following command surrounded by backticks (` `), or run the command and
    input the flags:
      wx-config --libs all
