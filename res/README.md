## XPM Files
The XPM files contain small images that are used in the application. The image
information is stored in a C string, so these are embedded into the executable.

## XRC Files
The XRC files contain the window, dialog, and menu layouts used in the
application. These are embedded into the executable using the `wxrc` utility
provided by wxWidgets.
