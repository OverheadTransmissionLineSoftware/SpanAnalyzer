    what it's doing under the hood. Hopefully, most of the questions are already
    answered. If there is something that is missing or could be better
    explained, let someone know! See the Reporting section below.

  <h3>Bugs and Feature Requests</h3>
  <p>
    If something isn't working quite right, or there is a feature that can
    supercharge SpanAnalyzer, let someone know! See the Reporting Section below.
