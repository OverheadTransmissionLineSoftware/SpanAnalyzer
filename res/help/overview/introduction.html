  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>
    SpanAnalyzer is a program developed by Overhead Transmission Line Software
    (OTLS). It was built to provide transmission line engineers a flexible,
    open-source alternative for sag-tension calculations. The state of the
    current industry software is proprietary, and the calculation methods are
    left unexplained.

    Some of the engineering/calculation features include:
    <ul>
      <li>Single span sag-tension</li>
      <li>Inclined geometry</li>
      <li>Experimental Plastic Elongation (EPE) Cable Model</li>
      <li>Load and creep based stretch</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    Some of the user interface features include:
    <ul>
      <li>Load/save files with multiple span configurations</li>
      <li>Undo/redo actions</li>
      <li>Multi-threaded analysis</li>
      <li>Customizable reports</li>
      <li>Plotting</li>
      <li>Printing</li>
    </ul>
