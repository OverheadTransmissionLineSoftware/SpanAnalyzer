  <h1>Applicaton Files</h1>
  <p>
    SpanAnalyzer uses a few different file types to keep everything straight.
  </p>
  <h3>Config File</h3>
  <p>
    The config file holds the user settings, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Window size and layout</li>
      <li>Unit System</li>
      <li>Plot colors</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The file location depends on the platform and user.
    <ul>
      <li>Linux: $HOME/.config/otls/span-analyzer/spananalyzer.conf</li>
      <li>Windows: %AppData%\OTLS\SpanAnalyzer\spananalyzer.conf</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    If this file is not available on startup, a new one will be created.
  </p>
  <h3>Data File</h3>
  <p>
    SpanAnalyzer stores data that is loaded on every startup. This includes:
    <ul>
      <li>Cable File Paths</li>
      <li>Weathercases</li>
      <li>Analysis Filters</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The data file is stored alongside the config file (above) by default, but
    that can be changed in the application preferences. If this file is not
    available on startup, a new one will be created.
  </p>
  <h3>Cable Files</h3>
  <p>
    Cables are stored in separate files so that adding to and removing from the
    program is as modular as possible. Cable files have an extension of
    '.cable'. These files can be stored anywhere on the system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Only the cable filepath is stored in the application data file. On startup,
    SpanAnalyzer will load all cable files that it knows about. Use caution when
    moving cable files that may be referenced in the application data.
  </p>
  <h3>Document Files</h3>
  <p>
    SpanAnalyzer uses document files so projects can be closed and reopened at
    a later time. Document files have an extension of '.spananalyzer'. These
    files can be stored anywhere on the system.
  </p>
  <p>
    The document file stores details for the spans, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Name</li>
      <li>Cable</li>
      <li>Constraint</li>
      <li>Stretch Weathercases</li>
      <li>Span Length / Elevation Change</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The document file references application data, such as cables and
    weathercases. If any of the referenced data is removed, it may cause
    problems next time the document is loaded. Use caution when removing
    application data that may be referenced in document files.
