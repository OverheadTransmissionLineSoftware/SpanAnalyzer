  <h1>Editing Cables</h1>
  <p>
    As mentioned in the Application Files section, cable data is stored in
    individual files. SpanAnalyzer can help manage and edit these cable files.
  </p>
  <h3>Cable Manager</h3>
  <p>
    The cable manager is launched from the Edit menu, and shows all of the
    cables used in the application. The manager can add, remove, create new,
    edit, or change the ordering of cables in the list.

  <h3>Cable Editor</h3>
  <p>
    The cable editor is launched when an individual cable file needs to be
    edited.

    Most of the cable parameters are detailed in the Calculations help book.
    One notable difference is the mechanical elongation characteristics of the
    shell and core aren't defined by load, but instead by virtual stress. The
    virtual stress is the load of the component divided by the entire area of
    the cable. This allows elongation data to be reused and scaled for cables
    with similar stranding designs, but different nominal sizes.
