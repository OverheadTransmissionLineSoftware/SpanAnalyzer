  <h1>Plots</h1>
  <p>
    The plot will display the sag-tension solution selected in the Results
    Window.
  </p>
  <p>
    Plots are set to auto-fit the window by default. The plots also support
    panning and zooming. Panning is triggered by left click and drag, while
    zoom is triggered with scrolling. As soon as panning and zooming actions are
    done, auto-fitting is turned off. To re-enable auto-fit, right click the
    plot and select 'Fit Plot'.
  </p>
  <h3>Catenary Profile</h3>
  <p>
    The catenary profile plot shows the cable position. Only the vertical
    projection is displayed, so the transverse blowout is not captured.

    Plot options can be configured by right clicking, and selecting 'Options'.
  </p>
  <h3>Cable Model</h3>
  <p>
    The cable model plot shows the elongation characteristics of the cable.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are up to 3 curves shown on the plot. In this example:
    <ul>
      <li>Red = core component</li>
      <li>Blue = shell component</li>
      <li>Yellow = entire cable</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The dots align with the mechanical loading of the catenary.
