  <h1>Constraints</h1>
  <p>
    A cable constraint is a limit that the cable should not exceed. In
    SpanAnalyzer, a cable constraint does not impose the limits on the span or
    affect the sag-tension results. Constraints are instead displayed in a
    report that can be checked by the user.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cable constraints can be set to apply to a specific cable, or to all cables
    if the entry is blank. The constraints displayed in the report are filtered
    to display only the relevant constraints.
  </p>
  <h3>Cable Constraint Manager</h3>
  <p>
    The cable constraint manager is launched from the Edit menu, and shows all
    of the constraints used in the application. The manager can add, remove,
    edit, or change the ordering of constraints in the list.

  <h3>Cable Constraint Editor</h3>
  <p>
    The cable constraint editor is launched when an individual cable constraint
    needs to be edited.
