  <h1>Analyzing a Span</h1>
  <h3>Activating a Span</h3>
  <p>
    A span can be activated by double clicking the span, or by right clicking
    and selecting 'Activate'. The span is activated when the font turns bold.
  </p>
  <h3>The Analysis</h3>
  <p>
    Once a span is activated, it will trigger an analysis. The analysis will
    solve for every combination of weathercase and stretch condition. A solution
    entails:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Unloading the span from the constraint to the target
        weathercase/condition
      </li>
      <li>
        Reloading the span from the constraint to the target
        weathercase/condition
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The analysis usually finishes quickly on modern computer hardware.
    SpanAnalyzer also speeds things along by using all of the available CPU
    cores.
  </p>
  <h3>Deactivating a Span</h3>
  <p>
    A span can be deactivated to clear the analysis results. Right click on the
    span, and select 'Deactivate'.
