  <h3>Edit Window</h3>  
  <p>
    This window allows the spans to be edited, or activated for an analysis.
    There can be many spans in this window, but only one can be selected at a
    time.
  </p>
  <h3>Results Window</h3>
  <p>
    This window displays the results from the sag-tension analysis. There are
    multiple report and analysis filter options to narrow down the data. Only a
    single row can be selected at a time.
  </p>
  <h3>Plot Window</h3>
  <p>
    This window contains plots for both the catenary profile and the cable
    model. The information plotted will match the selection in the Results
    Window.
  <h3>Log Window</h3>
  <p>
    This window displays errors or warnings that are encountered. If something
    isn't working right, this should be the first place to check.
