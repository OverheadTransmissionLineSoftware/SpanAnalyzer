  <h1>Printing</h1>
  <p>
    SpanAnalyzer supports printing the active plot. Get the plot oriented, then
    capture the view with the printer.

  <h3>Page Setup</h3>
  <p>
    Look over the page setup for size and layout before printing. This can be
    launched from the File menu.
  </p>
  <h3>Preview / Print</h3>
  <p>
    Once you are ready to print, look in the File menu. A preview can be
    generated before printing if needed.
  </p>
  <p>
    During printing the background color is converted to white. This keeps ink
    from being wasted. Neutral line colors that show up well on white and dark
    backgrounds may be best if printing is used heavily.
