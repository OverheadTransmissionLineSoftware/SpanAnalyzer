  <h1>Editing Spans</h1>
  <p>
    Span data is stored in a document (.spananalyzer) file. All of the span
    editing starts from the Edit Pane. Spans can be added, removed, copied,
    edited, or moved within the list.
  </p>
  <p>
    To trigger an editing action, either:
    <ul>
      <li>Select a span and click a button in the edit pane.</li>
      <li>Right click a span and select a menu entry.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Span Editor</h3>
  <p>
    The span editor is launched when an individual span needs to be edited.

  <h5>Cable</h5>
  <p>
    The cable to use. All of the cables in the application data are displayed.
  </p>
  <h5>Constraint Limit</h5>
  <p>
    The constraint limit is the primary factor for setting the span tension.
    There are several methods to define the limit, but all are tied to a
    specific weathercase and condition.
  </p>
  <h5>Stretch</h5>
  <p>
    Stretch can be determined two different ways: heavy load and creep. There
    are weather cases that can be selected for each stretch type.
  </p>
  <h5>Span Type</h5>
  <p>
    The span type determines the which span geometry options are available.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Dead-end - Indicates that there is only a single span between dead-end
        structures. Only the line section geometry is used.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ruling Span - Indicates that there are several spans between dead-end
        structures. Both the line section and span geometry can be used.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h5>Geometry</h5>
  <p>
    The Line Section Geometry represents the average geometry of all the spans.
    Usually the average is weighted to favor longer spans.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Span Geometry represents the geometry of a single span within a line
    section.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Horizontal Spacing - The horizontal spacing between span ends.
    </li>
    <li>
      Vertical Spacing - The vertical spacing between span ends. Positive values
      indicate the ahead-on-line end is higher than the back-on-line end.
    </li>
  </ul>
