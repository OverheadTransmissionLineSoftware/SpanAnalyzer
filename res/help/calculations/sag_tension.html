  <h1>3. Sag-Tension</h1>
  <h3>3.1 Overview</h3>
  <p>
    Sag-tension methods allow an overhead cable to be modeled at varying ice,
    wind, temperature, and stretch combinations. To solve for this, a catenary
    is used to determine the mechanical loading and a cable model is used to
    determine how a cable elongates under load.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many of the steps involved in sag-tension are numerical, as there often
    isn't an analytical equation that can be developed. The end solution is
    producing a catenary model for the specific weathercase, which is often
    represented by horizontal tension and unit weight.
  </p>
  <p>
    The basic sag-tension process is as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Model the starting constraint(s)
        <ul>
          <li>Create catenary and cable model</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Reload to a specific weathercase
        <ul>
          <li>Create cable model</li>
          <li>Solve for a catenary model numerically</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The following sections detail how each model is used, and typical procedures
    that are done to find a sag-tension solution.
  </p>
  <h3>3.2 Using the Catenary Model</h3>
  <h5>3.2.1 Converting Weathercases to Unit Weight</h5>
  <p>
    The catenary unit weight incorporates the weight of the cable, as well as
    any additional weight due to ice and wind.
  </p>
  <p>
    Vertical weight is determined by summing the bare cable weight, and any
    accumulated ice.
  </p>
  <br />

  <img src="equation_22.png" alt="" />
  <br />
  <img src="unit_weight_vertical.png" alt="" />
  <br />
  <p>
    Transverse weight is determined by calculating the drag force on the largest
    projection area of the cable.
  </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <img src="equation_23.png" alt="" />
  <br />
  <img src="unit_weight_transverse.png" alt="" />
  <br />
  <p>
    The catenary unit weight is the vector sum of the vertical and transverse
    unit weight.
  </p>
  <br />
  <br />

  <h5>3.2.2 Projecting 3D End Point Spacings onto the 2D Catenary Plane</h5>
  <p>
    The 2D catenary plane is always aligned with the resultant unit load.
    Converting end point spacings from a 3D coordinate system to the 2D catenary
    plane may require the vertical and horizontal spacing projections to be
    adjusted. This occurs when a span has inclined 3D geometry and a transverse
    unit load.
  </p>
  <p>Vertical Spacing on 2D Catenary Plane:</p>

  <br />
  <p>Horizontal Spacing on 2D Catenary Plane:</p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <img src="equation_26.png" alt="" />
  <h5>3.2.3 Converting a Constraint Limit to Catenary Horizontal Tension</h5>
  <p>
    Constraint limits can be defined as:
    <ul>
      <li>H/w</li>
      <li>Horizontal Tension</li>
      <li>Length</li>
      <li>Sag</li>
      <li>Support Tension</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of the constraint limits can be converted directly to horizontal
    tension. For all remaining limit types, an iterative approach must be used.
    The iterative solution requires that the catenary unit weight and end point
    spacing are already known. The horizontal tension can be guessed, and the
    result verified against the constraint limit. 
  </p>
  <h3>3.3 Using the Cable Model</h3>
  <h5>3.3.1 Converting Catenary Tensions to Axial Tension</h5>
  <p>
    The catenary tension varies along the curve, as shown in the figure below.
    To account for this, the catenary tension is averaged using Equation 11 to
    produce a tension that is equivalent to the constant axial tensions in the
    cable model.
  </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <img src="tension_conversion.png" alt="" />
  <h5>3.3.2 Calculating Stretch for Cable Components</h5>
  <p>
    The stretch for the entire cable is defined by a temperature and load. The
    load on the individual component can then be determined, and set as the
    stretch point for the final modulus. When the cable is thermally shifted to
    different temperatures, this stretch load will remain constant for each
    component.
  </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <img src="cable_stretch_components.png" alt="" />
  <h5>3.3.3 Calculating Reloaded Cable Length</h5>
  <p>
    Cable models are used to calculate the length of the cable at a new state
    (temperature and load). The new cable length, also known as the reloaded
    cable length, is determined by the following method:
    <ol>
      <li>Create a cable model for the start state.</li>
      <li>Create a cable model for the finish state.</li>
      <li>
        Determine the start and finish strain values, based on the corresponding
        loads.
      </li>
      <li>
        Calculate the strain difference.
        <br />
        <br />
        <img src="equation_27.png" alt="" />
      </li>
      <li>
        The finished, reloaded length can be calculated using the following
        equations.
        <br />
        <br />
        <img src="equation_28.png" alt="" />
        <br />
        <br />
        <img src="equation_29.png" alt="" />
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    Figure 14 shows two cable models overlayed on the same chart. The starting
    model is the leftmost one, while the finish model has a temperature increase
    and is shifted to the right. By comparing the two strain points relative to
    each other the net strain difference between start and finish can be
    determined and used to solve for the reloaded length of cable according to
    the above equations.
  </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <img src="cable_strain_comparison.png" alt="" />
  <br />
  <p>
    This example shows that the axial load remained the same between the start
    and finish cable models. This is not always the case, however the same
    method can be applied even when the load changes between start and finish.
  </p>
  <h3>3.4 Reloading From Constraint to a Specific Weathercase</h3>
  <p>
    This is the heart of the sag-tension process: taking a cable from a known
    tension and weathercase/condition, and reloading at a new
    weathercase/condition to solve for the tension.
  </p>
  <p>
    General Overview:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The constraint models are fully defined, but the reloaded models are
        incomplete and need to be solved iteratively.
      </li>
      <li>
        The catenary horizontal tension determines the load-strain point on the
        corresponding cable model.
      </li>
      <li>
        The primary purpose for the cable models is calculating the reloaded
        cable length, as detailed in Section 3.3.3.
      </li>
      <li>
        The solution is found when the reloaded catenary length matches the
        reloaded cable length predicted by the cable models.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <br />
  <img src="sagtension_reloaded_models.png" alt="" />
  <br />
  <p>
    The detailed calculation process is as follows:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Create a catenary model for the constraint.
        <ol>
          <li>Solve the catenary unit weight using Section 3.2.1.</li>
          <li>Solve the catenary spacing using Section 3.2.2.</li>
          <li>Solve the catenary horizontal tension using Section 3.2.3.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a cable model for the constraint.
        <ol>
          <li>Set the cable model load-strain point using Section 3.3.1.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a cable model for the reloaded weathercase and condition.
        <ol>
          <li>
            The load-strain point is dependent on the catenary tension, so it
            cannot be set yet.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Solve for the catenary model and cable model load-strain point for the
        reloaded weathercase.
        <ol>
          <li>Solve the catenary unit weight using Section 3.2.1.</li>
          <li>Solve the catenary spacing using Section 3.2.2.</li>
          <li>Guess or refine the catenary horizontal tension.</li>
          <li>
            Set the reloaded cable model load-strain point using Section 3.3.1.
          </li>
          <li>
            Calculate the reloaded cable length using Section 3.3.3. The
            constraint model is the start and the reloaded model is the finish.
            The start length is the constraint catenary length, calculated using
            Equation 8.
          </li>
          <li>Calculate the reloaded catenary length using Equation 8.</li>
          <li>
            Compare the reloaded catenary length and reloaded cable length.
          </li>
          <li>If error is too large, repeat steps 3-7.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <h3>3.5 Determining Cable Model Stretch</h3>
  <p>
    Solving for the cable model stretch can usually be determined by reloading
    from the constraint weathercase and condition to the stretch weathercase
    and Initial condition, according to the steps detailed in Section 3.4. The
    stretch load will be the average tension of the reloaded catenary, which can
    be calculated using Equation 11.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the constraint condition is defined using a final modulus, the cable
    model stretch load can still be determined, but must be solved iteratively.
    The solution requires the reloaded catenary average tension to match the
    stretch load in the constraint cable model.
  </p>
  <h3>3.6 Span Geometry</h3>
  <p>
    Sag-tension modeling is usually limited to a single span. This is due to
    the additional complexity of solving for a simultaneous force balance at
    the support points in the line section.
  </p>
  <p>
    For line sections with a single span, the geometry can match the horizontal
    and vertical spacing of the span. The geometry does not need to be converted
    to an equivalent flat span.
  </p>
  <br />
  <img src="span_geometry_deadend.png" alt="" />
  <br />
  <p>
    For line sections with multiple spans, the geometry is typically simplified
    down to a single, flat representative span, call the Ruling Span.
    Sag-tension is done on this span alone, and then the sag-tension solution
    (i.e. horizontal tension) is applied to all spans in the line section.
