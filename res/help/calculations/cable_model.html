  <h1>2. Cable Model</h1>
  <h3>2.1 Overview</h3>
  <p>
    The cable model describes how the cable elongates as load increases. The
    x-axis represents strain, while the y-axis represents load.
  </p>
  <p>
    The cable elongation models are similar to material stress-strain models,
    but have some important differences.
    <ul>
      <li>
        The modulus of elasticity (stiffness) cannot be determined by material
        properties alone. The stranding design has a significant impact on the
        effective stiffness. This is difficult to account for analytically, and
        is often determined by empirical tests.
      </li>
      <li>
        For a new cable, plastic elongation occurs after any amount of load is
        applied. There isn't a specific yield stress as there is in material
        stress-strain models. When the cable is unloaded, the cable follows a
        different modulus of elasticity that accounts for the plastic
        elongation.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>2.2 Initial Polynomial</h3>
  <p>
    Elongation is modeled using a 4th order polynomial. To create the
    polynomial, data points are collected in a lab test and are regression
    fitted. The polynomial represents a new cable that has been subjected to
    minimal stretching. This state is called the 'Initial' condition.
  </p>

  <br />
  <p>
    Depending on how the regression fitting was done, the polynomial may pass
    through the origin, or it may intersect the x-axis at an arbitrary point.
    Although it is ideal that zero load equals zero strain, this is not
    necessary. The polynomial slope also typically decreases, indicating that
    that more plastic strain occurs at high loads.
  </p>

    Given a strain, the load can be calculated by:

  <h3>2.3 Temperature Shift</h3>
  <p>
    As the cable temperature changes from the reference temperature, the cable
    will either expand or contract based on the coefficient of thermal
    expansion. This is modeled by shifting the elongation curve along the strain
    axis by the amount of thermal strain from reference temperature. To
    calculate the thermal strain:

  <h3>2.4 Stretch</h3>
  <p>
    Stretch is modeled two separate ways. The methods are not additive - either
    the cable stretches from one or the other. Both methods rely on a
    combination of tension and time exposure to set a stretch point on the
    Initial Polynomial.
  </p>
  <br />
  <br />

  <p>
    If the load is decreased relative to the stretch point, the cable follows
    a different stiffness modulus than the polynomial. This stretched modulus,
    commonly referred to as the 'Final' modulus, is constant and should be
    steeper than any point on the Initial Polynomial.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the load is increased relative to the stretch point, the cable follows
    the Initial Polynomial. The stretch point will shift to match the highest
    load along the polynomial.
  </p>
  <h5>2.4.1 Creep Stretch Point</h5>
  <p>
    This method of stretching is caused at relatively low tensions over a long
    period of time. A special Creep Polynomial is used that shows how much
    plastic elongation has occurred relative to the Initial Polynomial. Like
    the Initial Polynomial, the Creep Polynomial uses data points that are
    collected in a long term lab test. The data points are typically
    extrapolated out to 10 years, and then are regression fitted to define the
    polynomial.
  </p>
  <p>
    To find the stretch point, a point on the Creep Polynomial is identified
    that matches the everyday loading of the cable. The Final modulus is
    extended from the Creep Polynomial point until it intersects the Initial
    Polynomial, which will set the stretch point.
  </p>

  <h5>2.4.2 Load Stretch Point</h5>
  <p>
    This method of stretching is caused at relatively high tensions over a short
    period of time. Icing and wind is typically associated with load based
    stretching. The highest load experienced by the cable sets the stretch point
    on the Initial polynomial.

  <h3>2.5 Components</h3>
  <p>
    Cables can be composed of non-homogenous materials. For high tension cables,
    there is often a core component which mechanically supports the outer shell
    component which conducts electricity. To model non-homogenous cables, two
    sets of data points are needed: one for the outer shell and one for the
    core. The total cable model can be determined by summing the core and shell
    components.

  <br />
  <p>
    Solving for the shell data points allows the component polynomial,
    temperature, and stretch to be modeled independently and summed together to
    model the load-strain behavior of the entire cable.
